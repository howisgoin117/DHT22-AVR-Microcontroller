# DHT22-AVR-Microcontroller

Attention:

-The file includes both DHT library and 16x2 LCD library

-So apparently there is a bug with sprintf displaying float values, it will print out garbage values on lcd screen. 

->I have a workaround with it, by forcing it to display the temperature value in integer (eg. 27.3C will be displayed as 273 C), things seem to work fine with this one. 

->possible culprit may be: "Your compilerâ€™s sprintf() implementation might not support floating-point formatting (%.1f) due to a minimal libc configuration (common in embedded systems like AVR-GCC to save space)."

-LEDs depend on Temp range have been updated.

Incoming features: 
+ UART to display on Hyperterminal

Work in progress...
